                    <p>Hi there! I’m Mari Morales, a 27-year-old mother of three wonderful children, living in the beautiful Colorado Springs. Family is the heartbeat of my life, and I’ve always cherished the moments we share in the kitchen. To me, cooking isn’t just about preparing meals—it’s about creating memories and nurturing those we love.</p>

                <div class="about-text-box">
                    <p>In 2011, I embarked on a culinary journey, inspired by the desire to be more involved in my children's diet and to bring healthy, tasty food into our home. What started as a personal mission to ensure my family enjoyed nutritious meals has blossomed into a passion that I’m excited to share with you. Over the years, I’ve discovered that cooking at home can be a delightful adventure, filled with the joy of experimenting with new flavors and techniques, all while keeping our meals wholesome and enjoyable.</p>
