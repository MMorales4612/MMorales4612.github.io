                <h2>So, Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello! I’m Mari Morales, a 27-year-old wife and mother of three wonderful children, living in beautiful Colorado Springs. My life revolves around my family, and being a stay-at-home mom allows me to dedicate all my time and energy to creating a loving home environment. I am passionate about cooking and have honed my skills over the years, primarily through self-teaching and experimenting with various recipes. My culinary journey is deeply rooted in my desire to provide nutritious and delicious meals for my family. From early mornings filled with pancake-making to cozy dinners around the table, every meal is an opportunity to bring my loved ones together. When I'm not in the kitchen, you can find me enjoying outdoor activities with my family, tending to our garden, or organizing fun, educational activities for my kids. Life in Colorado Springs is wonderful, and I'm grateful for the chance to share my cooking journey with you!</p>

                <h2>Where It Began</h2>
                <p>In 2011, I decided to embark on a new journey—one that would significantly impact my family’s life. With three young children at home, I wanted to take a more active role in what they were eating. I realized that by creating my own recipes, I could ensure they were getting nutritious, wholesome meals that they would enjoy. It all started with a simple goal: to make cooking a fun and engaging activity for both me and my kids. I began experimenting with different ingredients, cooking techniques, and recipes that were not only healthy but also kid-friendly. Each new dish became a family adventure, from picking fresh vegetables from our garden to mixing ingredients together. My passion for creating family meals grew, and with each successful recipe, I found joy in seeing my children’s faces light up with every bite. This journey has been a rewarding experience, and it has taught me so much about the importance of involving my children in the kitchen and making healthy eating a family affair.</p>
